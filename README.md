This python application allows you to create the perfect smoothie every time. Using decision trees and set theory, it will make sure that all of the flavors and amounts added are compatible. Currently, this is a standalone Python program. I am currently working on getting certified in Azure Machine Learning and incorporating ML functions to more accurately predict whether the smoothie will be good.
